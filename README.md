# YouTube Bookmarker

A simple little Chrome extension that lets you save timestamps on YouTube videos.  
If you watch long videos, tutorials, lectures, or anything where you want to “remember this moment,” this extension helps you jump back with one click.

---

## ✨ What it can do
- Save the current timestamp of any YouTube video
- Add an optional label (like “start of section 3”)
- Jump straight back to any saved bookmark
- Bookmarks are stored separately for each video
- Clear bookmarks for one video or everything at once
- Works automatically on YouTube — no setup needed

---

## 🆕 What’s new in v1.1
This version doesn’t change any major behavior — it just makes the experience nicer:

- Cleaner and more structured popup
- Better button styling and dark mode look
- More reliable updating when switching videos
- Minor improvements in the background scripts

It's a small polish update — the big changes are coming in v2.0.
